We have used filters instead of hiding CSS, that gives you more control over the hide features regardless of the CSS or design of your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the plugin settings page? =
Go to Dashboard >> settings >> Hide Manager

= Can I hide selected Page/Post Titles? =
Yes, Hide Manager gives you the option to hide selective page/post ids.

= Will it hide featured image from all the areas where my post is visible?=
Hide Manager only hides the featured image on blog detail page. The featured image is perfectly visible on the main blog page, widgets areas and related posts section.

=The hide featured image option does not work?=
This plugin hides the featured image from single.php, when the function is written on single.php file. If the function is included from another file, then this feature wouldn't work. Since most of the premium themes and even free themes include the featured image function from another file. So hide featured image feature might not work on the themes where this particular function is written more deeply.
